# BIGGVirtualPiano
Piano that uses hand recognition from camera to identify different key presses

The plan is:
1. Import mediapipe in order to use hand landmarks and then develop an algorithim to identify key presses
2. Use said algorithim and mediapipe to identify location of key presses
3. Play appropriate tone
